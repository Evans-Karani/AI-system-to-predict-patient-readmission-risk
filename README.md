 AI System to Predict Patient Readmission Risk

This project applies the AI Development Workflow to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge. It uses a real-world diabetes dataset and demonstrates each phase of development — from problem definition to deployment.

 Project Objectives

- Predict if a patient will be readmitted within 30 days.
- Identify key predictors (lab tests, procedures, diagnoses).
- Deploy a trained model that can be integrated into hospital systems.

 Stakeholders

- **Hospital Administrators** — to reduce avoidable readmissions.
- **Physicians** — to make informed post-discharge decisions.

Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999–2008](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonalisingh1411/hospital-readmission)
- Rows: 101,766 | Columns: 50
- Target column: `readmitted` (reclassified as binary target: `<30` → 1, otherwise → 0)
